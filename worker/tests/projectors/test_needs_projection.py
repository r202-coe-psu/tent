"""`public_needs` projection — what the donor-facing board is actually allowed to see.

The board is an aggregate per ITEM (schema.md §2.4 / T-60): two campaigns asking for
`item:water` produce one card whose quantity is their sum, named from the catalog. The
campaign's own title and notes never cross to the public plane.

`visible_on_home` is the back-office toggle (CR-034) and this projection is the only
public surface reading campaign needs — so hiding a campaign has to take effect here.
